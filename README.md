# Object Detection for General Applications

# Introduction
A General Object Detection framework is one that should be able to detect any given object based on specific features. For instance, one can implement a corner detection framework from the contrasting pixel intensity between the corners of a given object and its immediate surroundings. 

However for this project, I was looking into contrasting the pixel intensity of the object with the entire environment. By studying the unique colors of the given object, we are thus able to isolate the object for detection.

# Details of the Game
The backend of the game resembles the popular game, Flappy Bird. However the simple goal is to detect the ability of the computer to detect the object and perform tasks, thus only an abstract representation of the game is required. 

By altering the position of the object, we are thus able to control the movement of the bird in the game.
